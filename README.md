# Tameta 🍅

Tameta is gujarati for tomatoes!

# Install

`cargo install tameta`

# Usage

`tameta`


# Motivation

This was originally written using ratatui and then using cursive, and then I just got bored and
decided to write it all from scratch, trying to use as few dependencies as possible. Just as a 
challenge for myself. Maybe I have been watching too much `Tsoding` and have a deeply ingrained
hatred for bloat.
